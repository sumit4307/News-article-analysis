1. Clean Up Articles: We'll remove unnecessary clutter like punctuation and common
words to focus on the main ideas.
2. Check the Mood: We'll build a system to figure out if an article is happy, sad, or
neutral about a topic.
3. Find Connections: We'll look for common themes across many articles, like seeing a
pattern in tech news.
